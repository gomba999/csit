## Adaptive Capacity Sweep

This sweep first increases the configured send rate geometrically to find the saturation region, then performs midpoint refinement to narrow the offered-rate interval that saturates the node.
Results are reported separately for each fixed `(mode, clients, payload)` case. The reported rate is the aggregate offered load across all clients in that case. For request-reply and fire-and-forget, effective throughput is sink-observed total node throughput. For write mode, effective throughput is sender-completed write throughput because no responder is running.

- Modes: `request-reply`
- Clients: `1`
- Sizes: `16384` bytes
- Start rate: `1000` msg/sec
- Max rate: `8000` msg/sec (0 means unbounded by rate cap)
- Growth factor: `2.00`
- Plateau threshold: `5.00%` effective throughput gain
- Plateau steps: `1`
- Max steps: `6`
- Repeats per sweep step: `25`
- Refinement steps after coarse sweep: `4`
- Minimum offered-rate interval after refinement: `250` msg/sec

### Sink-Backed Modes

#### Request-Reply Clients=1 Payload=16384B

Best offered aggregate rate: `1000` msg/sec
Estimated capacity offered-rate interval: `[1000, 1250]` msg/sec
Best observed node throughput: `12.38` msg/sec with 95% CI [12.38, 12.38]
Best sender-completed throughput: `12.16` msg/sec with 95% CI [12.14, 12.17]
Best node CPU: `0.64` % with 95% CI [0.59, 0.69]
Best total CPU: `4.32` % with 95% CI [4.25, 4.39]
Stop reason: refinement narrowed the estimated capacity to offered rates 1000 through 1250
